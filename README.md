Anomaly Detection is a pivotal tool in understanding collisions in particle colliders, as unknown less common outcomes of collisions can be viewed statistcally as anamolies to be detected. 
This repository walkes through setting up: a conda environment capable of running anomaly detection through pytorch; a ineffective but educational convolutional network; and a novel Wassterstein
normalized autoencoder trained on simulated Jet Data. To best make use of this project, follow the README in the Setup folder, and then setup the wassterstein normalized autoencoder using the same 
running architecture but fully utilizing the parallel computing power of the cluster.
