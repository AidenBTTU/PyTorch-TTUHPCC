# PyTorch-TTUHPCC
How to set up and run code on the HPCC at TTU. In my example, I use a high energy physics dataset and a convolutional autoencoder to distinguish HtoBB from ZtoQQ. 

Step 1. Preparing the conda environment:

- Run this command 


  wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh | bash
  
- This should create a file that looks like this in your directory

- Run this file using the command:

  bash Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh

- From this you will need to route to your directory where conda.sh is stored. In my case I set my current directory to

  HOME/ENTER/etc/profile.d/conda.sh

  manually using this command:
